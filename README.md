# Forgot Password Finite State Machine by Jake R. Clarin - F2

**Program Details:**
- The attached files above are a Python program that helps the user reset and renew their password, given that they have already forgotten it.
- If for instance, the inputted data does not abide by the validity of the rules, it would then move to another state or even stay until the user successfully entered the valid data. Likewise, when the user inputs the necessary and accurate information depending on the state they are in. 

**States:**
- State ‘q0’ (Initial State): Email Input
- State ‘q1': Code Verification
- State ‘q2’: Reset Password
- State ‘q3': Trying Login
- State ‘q4’ (Final State): Login Success
- State ‘q5': Login Failed
